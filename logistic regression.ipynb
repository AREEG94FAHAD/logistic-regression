    "Logistic regression is a statistical and machine-learning technique for categorizing records in a dataset based on their input field values. It is a classification algorithm for categorical variables. Logistic regression is analogous to linear regression but tries to predict a categorical or discrete target field instead of a numeric one. In logistic regression we predict a binary such as yes/no, true,false or multi-class. In logistic regression independent variables should be continuous. if categorical, they should be dummy or indicator coded (i.e, transform them to some continuous value). "

    "To predict categorical classes using linear regression, we need to set a threshold. Any value above the threshold will be considered (one, or true) even if it is one thousand, and any value below the threshold will be considered zero or false. And this will not give us the probability of belonging to a class that is very desirable. Logistic regression is preferable for solving a linear regression problem with categorical data. The logistic regression algorithm is based on the sigmoid function it also called logistic function, which calculates the likelihood (probability) of belonging to a class instead to reurn the value of y. Sigmoid function it always returns value between 0 and 1. \n",
